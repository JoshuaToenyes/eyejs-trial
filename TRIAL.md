# EyeJS Trial and Evaluation

## Things to Avoid

### Don't Evaluate the Webpage

We don't want to evaluate the design or usability of the webpages used during this trial. Only the amount of time taken to *activate* navigation elements, and accuracy should be considered, not the amount of time taken to *locate* the navigation element. However, when the user is finding information and we are considering distraction caused by EyeJS, we should not give hints or clues as-to where that information is located.


## Questions to Answer

### Primary Questions

- Can the user effectively navigate websites and perform common tasks using EyeJS?
- How does the speed and accuracy of EyeJS usage compare to that of a standard mouse?

### Secondary Question

- Does a visible gaze indicator increase or decrease user speed and/or accuracy?
- Does automatic page scrolling decrease the amount of time it takes for users to perform the tasks?


## Tasks

- Synthetic Interaction
- Wikipedia Navigation and Information Extraction
- Amazon.com Navigation and Information Extraction
- Reading Comprehension with Fading Sidebar

### Synthetic Navigation Task

This task will present the user with a variety of navigation buttons and elements on a single page. They will need to activate a random dictated sequence of elements using EyeJS or the mouse. Speed and accuracy will be
considered. The elements will be of random size and position.

#### Task Description

This task will be a series of screens with interactive buttons, each labeled with a letter. With each successive screen, the buttons will change size (get smaller as difficulty increases) and the density will change (how close buttons are to each other).

During the trial we will also vary the size of the gaze area (gaze indicator).

#### Things to Consider

- The difference in speed and accuracy of the user when using EyeJS versus a standard mouse.
- How size and density of interactive elements affect the speed and accuracy of the user.
- How does the gaze area (size of the gaze indicator) affect the user's speed and accuracy.


### Wikipedia Task

This task tests the user's ability locate and interpret specific information on a webpage, while navigating using eye tracking.

#### Things to Consider

- Will the user be distracted by a visible gaze indicator?
- Is the user faster or slower if the gaze indicator is visible?
- How does automatic scrolling affect the user's navigation ability and speed of navigating the page?
- Does the link-highlighting distract the user from the information they are seeking?

#### Task Sequence

1. Visit [http://wikipedia.org](http://wikipedia.org)
2. Select **English**
3. Select the **Science** portal.
4. Preview the *Selected Picture*
5. Search for "UCSD"
  - Read the number of undergraduate students enrolled at UCSD.
  - Read the number of acres of campus.
6. Navigate to *Global Rankings*
  - Read the *Washington Monthly* ranking of UCSD
  - Read the *ARWU* ranking of UCSD

### Amazon Task

#### Things to Consider

- Can the user navigate a link-dense environment like Amazon.com?
- Are they able to discover that they can activate videos by looking at them, and pressing the *select* button?
- Does image *zooming* distract the user?

#### Task Sequence

1. Visit [http://amazon.com](http://amazon.com)
2. Select **Shop by Department**
3. Select **Movies, Music & Games** > *Movies & TV*
4. Select *Birdman*
5. Select the cover image.
6. Start playing the *Birdman* trailer.
7. Stop playing the trailer.
  - Read the name of the 2nd Most-Helpful Customer Review
  - Read the date of the most helpful customer review


### Reading Comprehension with Fading Sidebar

This task will utilize a [Cloze Test](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloze_test) to measure how well the user can assimilate content from a page with potentially distracting sidebar elements. Using EyeJS, we will fade other elements from the page while the user is reading the text, only bringing them fulling into view when the user is looking at them. We are interested in determining if fading non-relavent information helps the user absorb task-related information faster or more accurately.

To ensure that the user is aware of the sidebar content, we will at some point require the user to interact with it, such as to navigate to the next page.

#### Things to Consider

- Does fading non-relavent sidebar information with potentially distracting content help the user absorb task-related information more quickly and accurately?

#### Possible Variation

Include scrolling variations to determine if automatic scrolling helps or hinders the user.
